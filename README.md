kim - The Kubernetes Image Manager
==================================

***STATUS: EXPERIMENT - Let us know what you think***

This project is a continuation of the experiment started with `k3c`, however, unlike the original aim/design for `k3c`,
it ***IS NOT*** meant to be a replacement or re-build of the [containerd](https://containerd.io)/CRI.

`kim` is a Kubernetes-aware CLI that will install a small builder backend consisting of a [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
daemon bound to the Kubelet's underlying containerd socket (for building images) along with a small server-side agent
that the CLI leverages for image management (think push, pull, etc) rather than talking to the backing containerd/CRI
directly. `kim` enables building images locally, natively on your [`k3s`](https://k3s.io) cluster.

## A familiar UX

There really is nothing better than the classic Docker UX of `build/push/pull/tag`.
This tool copies the same UX as classic Docker (think Docker v1.12). The intention
is to follow the same style but not be a 100% drop in replacement.  Behaviour and
arguments have been changed to better match the behavior of the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## A single binary

`kim`, similar to `k3s` and old school docker, is packaged as a single binary, because nothing is easier for
distribution than a static binary.

## Built on Kubernetes Tech (and others)

Fundamentally `kim` is a built on the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api),
[containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd), and [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).

## Architecture

`kim` enables building `k3s`-local images by installing a DaemonSet Pod that runs both `buildkitd` and `kim agent`
and exposing the gRPC endpoints for these active agents in your cluster via a Service. Once installed, the `kim` CLI
can inspect your installation and communicate with the backend daemons for image building and manipulation with merely
the KUBECONFIG that was available when invoking `kim install`. When building `kim` will talk directly to the `buildkit`
service but all other interactions with the underlying containerd/CRI are mediated by the `kim agent` (primarily
because the `containerd` "smart client" code assumes a certain level of co-locality with the `containerd` installation).

## Building

```bash
# more to come on this front but builds are currently a very manual affair
# git clone --branch=main https://github.com/rancher/kim.git ~/Projects/rancher/kim
# cd ~/Projects/rancher/kim
go generate # only necessary when modifying the gRPC protobuf IDL, see Dockerfile for pre-reqs
make ORG=<your-dockerhub-org> build publish
```

## Running

Have a working `k3s` installation with a working `$HOME/.kube/config` or `$KUBECONFIG`, then:

```bash
# Installation on a single-node cluster is automatic
# Installation on a multi-node cluster, targeting a Node named "my-builder-node"
./bin/kim install --selector k3s.io/hostname=my-builder-node

```

`kim` currently works against a single builder Node so you must specify a narrow selector when
installing on multi-node clusters. Upon successful installation this node will acquire the "builder" role.

Build images like you would with the Docker CLI:

```
$ ./bin/kim --help
Kubernetes Image Manager -- in ur kubernetes buildin ur imagez

Usage:
  kim [OPTIONS] COMMAND
  kim [command]

Examples:
  kim image build --tag your/image:tag .

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  image       Manage Images
  system      Manage KIM

Images Shortcuts:
  build       Build an image
  images      List images
  pull        Pull an image
  push        Push an image
  rmi         Remove an image
  tag         Tag an image

Flags:
  -x, --context string      kubeconfig context for authentication
      --debug               
      --debug-level int     
  -h, --help                help for kim
  -k, --kubeconfig string   kubeconfig for authentication
  -n, --namespace string    namespace (default "kube-image")
  -v, --version             version for kim

Use "kim [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Roadmap

- Automated builds for clients on MacOS (amd64/arm64), Windows (amd64), and Linux client/server (amd64/arm64/arm).
